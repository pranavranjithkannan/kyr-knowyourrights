# KYR - Know Your Rights

## Problem Statement
Access to legal information and awareness is a challenge for a large population in India, especially for those who are not literate or are from marginalized communities. There is a need to provide a user-friendly and easily accessible platform for legal awareness.

## Our Solution
We are developing "KYR - Know Your Rights," a digital assistant to provide legal information and guidance in a user-friendly manner. This assistant will converse in multiple languages, addressing common legal queries and providing information on various legal topics. Our aim is to improve legal awareness and access to justice, particularly for marginalized communities.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React (completed)
- Backend: Node.js (work in progress)
- AI Integration: Google Vertex AI for training with custom datasets (in progress)

### Progress Update
We have completed the frontend development and are currently training the AI model. The backend integration with Google Vertex AI will be completed as soon as possible.
